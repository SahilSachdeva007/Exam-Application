For easier understanding I have added a video of how things will work in this project.

You will need to go to the iCoder directory  and then use command python manage.py runserver and then follow the

Only the user knowing username and password can access the Django administration Database.(ex- teachers)

Clicking on ADD POST will display some options and MCQ's can be added as per the teacher's prefrence.

By clicking on Blog Comments the teacher can see the comment/answer added by the student.

Login and SignUp functionality works fine here.

After new signUp user credentials are added to the database.

Only after successful login students can give the exam.

Also we have a feature of logout in here.
